## Publish-subscribe pattern

Also abbreviated as pub/sub. Publishers do not know about subscribers. Publishers publish messages into classes. Subscribers subscribe to classes they are interested in.

Topic-based filtering means messages are published into "topics", which are named logical channels. Subscribers subscribe to the topics then.
