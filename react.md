GitBook allows you to organize your book into chapters, each chapter is stored in a separate file like this one.

[Redux and Relay are exclusive](https://github.com/rackt/redux/issues/1036)

Redux is currently the winner from all Flux implementations.
- most popular, mentioned as winner in many discussions
- works with react-router - same contributors
- isomorphic in mind

What can Redux offer?
What can Relay offer?
What is better fit for me.


I need to fix spot search bugs. (And also proceed forward with isomorphism soon.)
→ Upgrade react-autosuggest.
→ Upgrade react.
→ Upgrade react-router.
→ Find out how to replace Router.run callback for Flux store.
